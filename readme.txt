we need binary tree, we need file i/o, we need to reduce the amount of bits
from input file and produce the compressed version into output file
output binary tree post-order
save encoded file



  Read the file to be encoded and construct the Huffman coding tree;
(2)    Display the Huffman codes to standard output. 
The output should follow the format:
